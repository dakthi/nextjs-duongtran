        When I was younger, I dreamed of becoming a doctor — it felt like the best way to help people.
        That&apos;s what led me to study medicine. But during my first year at university, I realised something important:
        even though I admired the profession, it didn&apos;t align with my strengths or what I wanted to do every day.
      </p>

      <p>
        Later on, I came across accounting — almost by chance. The more I studied it, the more I enjoyed it.
        Maybe it was my love for numbers, or maybe it was something deeper. I discovered that accounting
        wasn&apos;t just about spreadsheets or tax — it was a way to support people in a very real, impactful way.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, I work with founders and small business owners — especially those just starting out — and
        I focus on more than just getting the job done. I walk alongside them. I explain the why behind
        the numbers. I build systems that save time. I help them feel confident in decisions, not just compliant.
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe accounting isn&apos;t just a service. It&apos;s a relationship built on trust and shared growth.
        I care deeply about the people I work with, and I take full responsibility for my clients.
        I don&apos;t just want to tell you what you owe in tax — I want you to understand what&apos;s really going on,
        and how to move forward with clarity.
      </p>

      <p>
        I&apos;m completing the final stage of my ACCA qualification and have over three years of hands-on experience.
        Alongside that, I&apos;ve taught myself automation using Python and APIs, built internal tools to save teams hours of work,
        and created documentation and training resources that scale well across growing companies.
      </p>

      <p>
        I especially love working with startups. Many founders begin with zero knowledge of tax or accounting,
        and that&apos;s perfectly okay. Everyone starts somewhere. I help them make those first decisions —
        whether it&apos;s choosing a business structure, understanding cost strategy, or getting ready for their first VAT return.
      </p>

      <p>
        For me, AI is not a threat — it&apos;s a tool. I use it to automate admin, so I can focus more on
        conversations, planning, and strategy. I&apos;ve built scripts that pull company data, rename 500+ invoice files,
        and even process PDFs to Excel in seconds — all so we can spend more time on what matters.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I work inside a company, I treat it as if it were my own. I don&apos;t just do tasks — I look for systems
        that can improve the way the team works. That&apos;s what I love: solving real problems, creating lasting value,
        and building clarity into the backbone of the business.
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe the best accountants aren&apos;t just technically good — they&apos;re curious, thoughtful, and invested
        in their clients&apos; success. I don&apos;t just want to “file things” — I want to help you make better decisions,
        understand your numbers, and move forward with less stress.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you&apos;re a founder or small business owner and want to work with someone who truly cares — about both
        your business and your peace of mind — I&apos;d love to meet.
