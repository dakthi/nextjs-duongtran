    "description": "If you're a small business owner or an independent professional, I understand how hard it can be to make sense of the numbers. Most accountants are always rushing from one tax return to another, which means less time to explain things properly. As a result, you hesitate to ask because you don't want to bother them, and cross your fingers that they do things right, blindly. That's the usual way things go, but it doesn't have to be.",
