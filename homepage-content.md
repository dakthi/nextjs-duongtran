## Section 1: Main Message
**Pre-title:** Duong Tran

**Title:** It's okay not to know where to start

**Description:**
If you're a small business owner or an independent professional, I understand how hard it can be to make sense of the numbers. Most accountants are always rushing from one tax return to another, which means less time to explain things properly. As a result, you hesitate to ask because not wanting to bother them, and finger cross that they do things right, blindly. That's the usual way things go, but it doesn't have to be.

## Section 2: Benefit One
**Title:** I streamline and automate, so there is more time to listen to you

**Description:**
AI, contrary to what some may think, might be the secret sauce that accounting industry have been waiting for so long. It saves my time, so I can focus on what matters the most, you, your business and your story.

**Bullet Points:**

1. **Streamlined process means higher accuracy**
   By standardising the team finely and intricately honed procedures over the years, it helps us see the bigger picture and fix bottleneck and improve accuracy among all phases.

2. **Automation means less human errors in mundane tasks**
   Instead of spending 3 hours typing VAT invoices into spreadsheets, AI agents now do that in 3 minutes, and our team spend the rest of the 3 hours checking it, spotting more anomalies and accounting risks.

3. **Innovation means you benefit more everyday**
   Every single day, we look at our playbook and think "is there a better way to do this?", "can it be easier for the clients?". As a result, working with accountants become more and more pleasant and strategic, instead of pedantic.

Work should be smarter, not harder. I constantly optimise workflows so you spend less time worrying about compliance and more time building your dreams.

**Bullet Points:**

1. **Cutting through complexity**

2. **Designed for growth**
   I create templates, improve systems, and share best practices, helping businesses become more efficient, agile, and ready for what's next.

3. **Technology that serves people**
   Automation and optimisation are powerful, but the heart of business is human. I use tech to make life easier, not to replace personal connection.
